I'm a 26 years old, British developer who is fascinated by online browser games. I first built external tools to help with the game Lioden, which I called [LioExt](https://lioext.paigejones.me/). Recently, I have begun working on a framework called [Haunt](https://hauntframework.com/) which is still under *heavy development*, as well as building my own game called [Archwardens](https://archwardens.com/) which is also a work-in-progress.
